    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step1.webp" alt="step 1" height="300">
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step2.webp" alt="step 2" height="300">
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step3.webp" alt="step 3" height="300">
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step4.webp" alt="step 4" height="300">
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step5.webp" alt="step 5" height="300">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step6.webp" alt="step 6" height="300">
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>  
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step7.webp" alt="step 7" height="300">
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <img src="../images/Lasagna/step8.webp" alt="step 8" height="300">
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
